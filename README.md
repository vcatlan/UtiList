# UtiList
Mobile App Project UNCC

The appâ€™s main functionality is to provide the user with tools that can keep track of their needs.
More specifically their shopping needs (shopping list) and daily need (to-do list). 
The user can create and account for the app and connect with other users by friend requesting them. 
That way they can share specific lists with each other for different reasons which can help collaboration in a to-do lists for instance.
